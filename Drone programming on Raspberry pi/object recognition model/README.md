In this file we are creating a deep learning model for recognizing obejects by using real time video footage.

Inside this folder there are the python scripts to create a deep learning model for object recognition by capturing images from a video and then using those images to train a model. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire process, from video processing to model training.

First we will discuss about the steps we need to complete the process of object recognition using this deep learning model.

Steps:
1. video capturing 
First we must have the video recording to use as the input data.

2. Secondly we must extract data from the video. To do that we are using tools such as opencvThese frames will be saved as individual images to use as training data.

3. Manually label the extracted images with the appropriate object categories.

4. Resize the images to a uniform size, normalize pixel values, and split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

5. We are using a convolutional neural network model as the fundamental architecture for the deep learning model. 

6. Train the model using the labeled image dataset. This involves feeding the data into the model, allowing it to learn the features of the object.

7. Use the validation and test datasets to evaluate the performance of the trained model. 

8. Save the trained model to a file for future use.
Deploy the model to recognize the desired object in real-time video footage or images.
