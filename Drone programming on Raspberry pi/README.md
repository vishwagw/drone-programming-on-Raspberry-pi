We have to creat a deep learning model that can detect and recognize obstacles/objects based on the data captured from obstacle photographs.

First we must collect image data that include obstacles and use this data to train a model.

To collect image data for training the deep learning model, it is important to gather as many different types of obstacle images as possible. This can be done by searching the internet or taking pictures with a camera or smartphone. The collected images should include both images that contain obstacles and images that do not.

Once the image data has been collected, the deep learning model can be trained based on this data.
