Thsis project contains an autonomous drone programming files and instructions. 
We are using a raspberry pi computer.
We also using python programming language for most of the code.
python based libraries:
1. dronekit
2. pymavlink
3. opencv

autonomous flight folder contains the python codes for autonomous flight capabilities. 
Inside the folder there is a test flight folder for testing the developed system.

GPIO = General purpose input/output
